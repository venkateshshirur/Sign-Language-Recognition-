# Sign Language Detector using Custom ML Model

Sign language recognition is essential for fostering effective communication within the Deaf community. This paper introduces an innovative approach to real-time recognition of alphabet signs, utilizing computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The proposed system integrates Media Pipe for precise hand landmark detection and OpenCV for efficient video processing. Hand landmarks are then classified using a Random Forest Classifier implemented with the Scikit-Learn library, optimized for performance using Intel oneAPI-optimized Scikit-Learn. By combining these technologies, the system achieves accurate and efficient recognition of alphabet signs, serving as a valuable tool for bridging communication barriers between the Deaf and hearing communities.
Keywords: Sign Language Recognition, Media Pipe, Random Forest, Scikit Learn, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, OpenCV.

This project is capable of reading 31 different signs, including 26 alphabets and 5 words.

The following words can be recognized: Yes, No , Please, Thank You, Hello

The project explores three different machine learning algorithms:

—Support Vector Machines (SVM)
—Random Forest
—Gradient Boosting

to compare their accuracy and performance on hand sign image data.
